# 3D_FCN

# how to visualize:
call: python3 main_Marius.py, dont worry about the folder you're in, just remember to give the correct absolute paths

script will ask you for the folder where all of your datasets are, please enter it in the command line and press ENTER
then it will ask you for the specific dataset you want to work with, , please enter it in the command line and press ENTER
it will load the dataset and list all of the available data points in there, alias RUN_xx in my case
then it will ask you to enter the number of the data points you want to work with. please remember that from now on it works with the indices where the data is loaded to in datasets["train"] and not the name of the run as provided in RUN_xx, please enter it in the command line and press ENTER
in the end the script asks you to enter the desired view. please choose one thats named in the list in the terminal, enter the name in the correct spelling and press ENTER
you can then find the respective file in the visualization/pics folder


good luck, feedback and corrections are appreciated!
