## GPU support
- if you want to use the GPU, you need to install pflotran with cuda support
- check nvidia-smi for the available gpus and cuda version
- `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<gpu_id>` (e.g. 0)
- if the gpu is not found after suspension, try

    `sudo rmmod nvidia_uvm
    sudo modprobe nvidia_uvm`

    if it does not help, you have to reboot
